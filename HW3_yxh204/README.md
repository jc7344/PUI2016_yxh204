### Question 1

In this question, I borrowed Professor Bianco's code to create a list of 100 sample sizes between with $N$ between 100 and 2000. Using these sample sizes, I generated 100 samples from five different distributions to explore the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theroem. My analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW3_yxh204/HW3_1_yxh204.ipynb).

### Question 2

For this question, I worked in a team of four with my fellow classmates Cheng Hou, Xiaomeng Dong, and Yue Cai. We took a long time to get professor Bianco's function, which reads the CitiBike data directly from CitiBike's website, to work on our `compute` environments. We found that one line in a nested if-else statement of the function ought really be outside of that statement in order for the function to work properly.

Having read the data, we decided that the time component of this dataset is more interesting to us. After a few discussions, we decided to explore how different hours of the day affect the ridership of CitiBikes. The analysis I carried out on my part can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW3_yxh204/HW3_2_yxh204.ipynb).

### Question 3

This question is about hypothesis testing. More specifically, using `Python` to conduct a Z-test for mean. The answer to this question can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW3_yxh204/HW3_3_yxh204.ipynb).
