Good description of the concept, and formulation of the hypotheses. The only objection I have is that 'mean ridership' is still not a well defined measurable quantity: is it the total number of rides that stats within those hours? the total number of rides that start and end within those hours? the total number of bikes out at those hours etc etc.

Good data wrangling and set up. Generally pep8 discourages the use of 'lambda functions" so you should limit their use to when you actually need to create a fincion on the fly (i.e. when you want to create the function as the argument of another function, like we saw for example in the chapter 7 od Data Analysis with python notebook)

Your data can now be compared with a test for proportions for example (e.g. chi sq), or a test of averages between 2 samples (e.g. t)

There was indeed a bug in my function to download data, but it would be solved with a different indent (the indents got messed up in copy-paste) better than with another if-else. look at the updated version.
