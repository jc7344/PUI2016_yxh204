### Assignment 1

JSON files contain nested lists and dictionaries when read into Python. Working with this file type is like peeling an onion layer by layer until you found the information that you're looking for. The exploratory analysis that I performed for assignment 1 and assignment 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW2_yxh204/exploring_MTAbus_data.ipynb).

### Assignment 3

The CUSP data facility stores many great datasets for urban informatics on CUSP's `compute` server. However, working with these datasets seemed difficult at first because they are stored in multiple layers of folders while having no `CSV` extensions for themselves. After a few explorations, I was able to perform the analysis as instructed (See [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW2_yxh204/Assignment2_yxh204.ipynb)).
