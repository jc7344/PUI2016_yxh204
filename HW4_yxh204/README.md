### Question 1

My partner for this question was Kristi Korsberg. My review for her Citi Bike ideas from homework 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_kk3374/blob/1847aa364add461bcad3c8e73a2316f6c387e94b/HW3_kk3374/CitibikeReview_yxh204.md).

### Question 2

I worked with Cheng Hou for this question. We discussed about how to read academic papers effectively given that we knew practically nothing about the fields in which the researches were conducted. We also talked about how to identify the independent, dependent, and control variables from an academic paper. The table that I created for this assignment is as [follows](https://github.com/kevinhan0/PUI2016_yxh204/blob/master/HW4_yxh204/HW4_2_yxh204.md):
